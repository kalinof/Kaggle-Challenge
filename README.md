# Kaggle-Challenge
The objective is to predict the revenue of shops. 
Dataset can be downloaded from here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/16ks3fowx7oLJNCZjf4dLsKOy4GyhKVdi/view
The challenge is to clean and prepare the dataset and then pick a method (e.g. KNN, Naive Bayes, Descision Trees, etc.)
Based on the r2 we pick the best algorithm. In the project we went with xgboost.
